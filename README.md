# San-Francisco-Housing-Price-Analysis
EDA analysis upon SF housing price using python and R

## Introduction

Here I implemented data visualization analysis upon San Francisco's house price in last 8 years.

The data source are from Redfin, US census website and USGS website.

The main EDA are in  [EDA 1](https://github.com/JiaqiCChen123/San-Francisco-Housing-Price-Analysis/blob/master/EDA%20analysis.ipynb) and [EDA 2](https://github.com/JiaqiCChen123/San-Francisco-Housing-Price-Analysis/blob/master/EDA%20analysis%202.ipynb).

## Tools

The data analysis part in done with __python__, and the EDA part is done in __gg-plot__ (an R package)

## Discription

I conducted the analysis in two ways:

1. I analysis the SF housing market price trending in different house types, housing status and time.

2. I try to find the potential purchanse opportunity by analysing the trend of crime rate and housing price in different regions (devided by zip codes) in San Francisco.
