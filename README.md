# San-Francisco-Housing-Price-Analysis

## Introduction

Here I implemented data visualization analysis upon San Francisco's house price in last 8 years.

The data source are from Redfin, US census website and USGS website. 

## Tools

The data analysis part in done with __python__, and the EDA part is done in __gg-plot__ (an R package)

## Discription

I conducted the analysis in two ways:
